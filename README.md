## License

### Specifics

Coptic SCRIPTORIUM provides a license for the Sahidica New Testament obtained from his original website. (http://kami.to.md/index.php?topic=50.msg204)

 eBible<nolink/>.org also provides a license that appears to have been obtained from there. (https://ebible.org/copbhc/copyright.htm)

 *  They list his Sahidica text as in the Public Domain, though that doesn't seem particularly accurate.

It would be good to have specific licenses for his other texts, which is also why contacting him is important.
