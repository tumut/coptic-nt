Representing the New Testament in the original Greek according to the Egyptian text, upon which the Sahidic was based. This Greek text was based on the CCAT lemmatized version of the United Bible Societies text corrected by James Tauber. \line\line\b TITLE NOTES\b0  \line\line "Egyptian" means the Greek text type Aland calls Alexandrian/Egyptian and Metzger calls Proto-Alexandrian/Alexandrian. The term "in the Original Greek" is often misunderstood to mean this represents the text as it was originally written. It does not imply that. It means this is "a version" of the New Testament in the language the original was written in. \line\line\b TEXT NOTES \line\b0\line Character representation in the Greek and Coptic texts.

\line\line Note: "UBS" herein means The Greek New Testament of the United Bible Societies, fourth revised edition (1994). \line\line\b Sections and Paragraphs\b0  \line\line Following each book-ch-vs, there may appear encoding: where "=" is a section break, and "-" is a paragraph break. These are aligned, but not identical, to those found in the UBS text where sections have headings. \line\line\b Purpose and Criteria\b0  \line\line The purpose is to provide a parallel Greek text for students and researchers who work with the Sahidic version. At the same time fabricating a hypothetical version of the Greek to correspond to the Sahidic has been avoided. To accomplish, this the CCAT lemmatized version of the UBS text corrected by James Tauber, was used as a basis. That Greek text has been altered to correspond to the Sahidic only where there is support in the UBS apparatus. This is a simplified text. The following marks are omitted: Accent, breathing, dieresis, subscript and elision. Punctuation marks have been removed except for periods and Greek question marks (";") which have been retained. This allows the student or researcher to compare differences between the Sahidic and the standard Greek texts. As a result this Greek text is encoded to be viewable with the Symbol font available in Microsoft Windows(R). \line\line To better serve the student or researcher, the following steps have been taken in modifying the Greek text. \line\line Brackets in the UBS/NA have been removed. Double brackets have been left. Commas have also been removed. Single brackets mark where the Sahidic witnesses read differently than the standard Greek text. Single brackets with hyphens within [--] indicates the Sahidic omits one or more words found in the Greek text. Where single brackets with hyphens within stand alone by a verse number, the Sahidic omits the entire verse. Double brackets with hyphens mark where the Greek text is not represented in the Sahidic witnesses. Double brackets with hyphens within [[--]] indicates the Sahidic omits a major section found in the UBS Greek. \line\line\b Interpolations\b0  \line\line The shorter and longer endings of Mark appear in most Sahidic mss. Herein the longer is given first. The pericope of the adultress (John 7:53 - 8:11) does not appear in any Sahidic mss. Herein it is omitted. \par
